# üì∞ News & Stock Analysis AI ‚Äì PR Newswire x Yahoo Finance üìà

Ever wondered how headlines impact the stock market?  
This Python-based project helps connect the dots by scanning automotive news articles and checking how they might relate to companies like **Ford (F)**, **General Motors (GM)**, and **Tesla (TSLA)**.

We pull real news stories, check if they mention these big auto stocks, then grab 30 days of price and volume data to see what the market‚Äôs doing ‚Äî and finally, we help answer the big question:  
**Is it time to buy, wait, or stay away?**

## üîç What This Project Does

Here‚Äôs how it works, step by step:

1. **Scrapes automotive news** from PR Newswire (last 2 weeks).
2. **Searches each article** to see if it mentions stock symbols like TSLA, GM, or F.
3. **Uses Yahoo Finance** to pull real stock data for the last 30 days.
4. **Plots clean, colorful charts** for price and volume.
5. **Analyzes stock trends** and recommends one of three actions:  
   ‚Üí `BUY STOCK!`  
   ‚Üí `WAIT BEFORE BUYING STOCK!`  
   ‚Üí `NOT BUY STOCK!`
